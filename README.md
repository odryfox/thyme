<h1>Thyme</h1>
Thyme is an instrument to manage your time.
I have been looking for a good application for a long time but I haven’t found a comfortable one. There are a lot of good to-do list applications like Google Calendar, iCal (by Apple). Now I use TickTick (do not confuse it with TikTok which can take all your free time and your soul). It covers just part of my needs but not all of them.

What is important for me in my todo application:

1. Intuitive statistics - i want to understand problems in the course of my day and better the way i spend my time from a long term point of view.
2. Tasks with and without particular time on one screen - I have some routine tasks every day and events with fixed time. I want to see all my day tasks and understand what I’m going to do.
3. Backlog/inbox - I want to have a place for my inbox tasks. It will make the application more friendly. If some idea occurs in your head, you will write it in one place and if you have free time today you may take tasks from your inbox.
4. Long time goals. I think that people use such applications when they have some goals. Almost all of their tasks are small steps to achieve these goals. I want to link tasks with some goal in order to give the answer to the question: why do I need to do it? It’s important for analyzing your tasks. Maybe some of them are not particularly interesting and useful for you. It will allow you not to waste time on extra tasks.
5. Daily/weekly notes. Every time you need to summarize your results and do some improvements in your process, you will need to do some experiments and notes will help with it.
6. There is no place for unnecessary details in this application. Every function should have purpose.
